Distributed Object Computing Team 4 Final Project
=================================================

This project is to demonstrate the use of several python libraries in transferring JSON data across several computers and returning it to its initial state. The project only supports Python 3 and does not support Python 2.

The four python scripts should be run in separate terminals in order to demonstrate full functionality. The Pyro4 nameserver needs to be run in the background using the command ''python3 -m Pyro4.naming'' before starting the process.

The nodes should be run in the following order:

* topNode.py
* rightNode.py
* botNode.py
* leftNode.py

The project source code can be found at 'https://github.com/kmikus/dist-object-team4'_.
